# odin-recipes

Welcome to the **Odin Recipes** project! This is one of the first hands-on projects from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), focused purely on building with basic HTML.

## 📋 Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a simple website that contains a main index page with links to several recipes. Each recipe will have its own page with ingredients and steps.

This project is **HTML only** — no CSS or JavaScript yet — so it helps solidify your understanding of:
- HTML structure and boilerplate
- Heading and paragraph tags
- Links and anchor tags
- Image embedding
- Lists (ordered/unordered)
- Page linking within a project folder

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated:
- Proper HTML document structure
- File organization and internal linking
- Usage of semantic HTML tags
- Using Git for version control (add, commit, push)
- Cloning and working with GitHub using SSH

## 🔁 Reflection (optional – for later)

This project was a great intro to real-world HTML coding. It helped me build muscle memory for writing HTML by hand and get more confident using Git and GitHub to manage my project history.
